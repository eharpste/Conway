/**
 * FastBoard is the main entity that runs all of the Game of Life code.
 * The Fast prefix is because I have made a number of improvements over the original Board class to keep it from taking 
 * 	egregious amounts of RAM or processing time to run within the render loop.
 * In general things are mostly self contained and documented, the category of misc methods at the end are random 
 * 	artifacts or toys that I felt like leaving in. 
 * The general architecture is 2D array of booleans that hold the cells.
 * Update runs the game of life on the grid, advanceBoard visually moves the grid down the screen.
 * There are various options to buffer the grid to keep adding to it as it moves off screen, there are also more 
 * 	efficient options for updating in batches.
 * 
 * Things to note:
 * 
 * Most processing should be done on currGrid not nextGrid. Next grid is for the update method to use.
 * 
 * currGrid[0][0] is the BOTTOM LEFT element on screen currGrid[length][0] is the BOTTOM RIGHT, currGrid[0][length] is the UPPER LEFT 
 * 	and currGrid[length][length] is the UPPER RIGHT
 * 
 * Throughout the documentation I make reference to 3 different spaces: board space, render space, and screen space.
 * Board space is the literal currGrid[y][x].
 * Render space is defined by OpenGL defining the center of the screen as (0,0) and going from -1 to 1 for the extends of the screen.
 * 	the values of bottom, and movementPerTick are in render space units
 * Screen space is defined by LibGDX to handle mouse and touch input and corresponds to the number of pixels from the top left of the screen.
 * 	no parameters current use this but I am working on a mapping function.
 * I am co-opting the "@deprecated" tag for methods I'm still experimenting with.
